Hi! &#128518;

Renz Santos here. I am a Software Engineer. I enjoy solving challenges with everyday technologies. I believe, together, we can build and empower an autonomous future.

Currently, I work at a major public safety technology business, covering engineering and product development of microservice applications hosted on various cloud platforms.

This site is a collection of both technical and non-technical items I have encounterd during my life. I hope you find it intriguing and stimulates your collective thought.

Have a great day! &#9788;
